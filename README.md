As the Internet has advanced , it's usage has skyrocketed. In this modern world , companies like Amazon and Flipkart have made fortunes using 
ecommerce. Almost every sellers out there are going online and doing their businesses. 
So this project is inspired from the growing digitalisation in the world. 
Thanks to Dennis Ivy (youtuber) who taught me how to make a shopping cart using pure html, css ,Javascript and Django. I leearned a lot from his tutorial series.

After completing the series I thought of writing an ecommerce site (not just a crud cart) using the emerging and popular Javascript library name React.
In the backend, after doing some research, I found out that I have to use Django Rest Framework  to create Rest APIs. I have also used **Redux** for advanced state manangement.

Most of the frontend HTML and CSS codes are copied from the Internet. About 70% of those are actually from Dennis's project. 
**The React Javascript and Backend part are fully custom.**
**I have added custom features like Registration using Token Authentication, Comment section, Product Detail View, Testimonial etc to make the site more complete.**
